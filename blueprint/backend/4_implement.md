## 2026-01-20

### Summary

- Updated backend blueprint to use **short-lived access JWT + refresh tokens** (instead of “discard JWT to logout”).
- Added refresh/logout endpoints and a `refresh_tokens` DB table specification to support real server-side logout.

### Notes

- **Migrations**: Backend schema spec now includes `refresh_tokens` (hashed token storage, rotation support).
- **sqlc**: Upcoming sqlc query set will need refresh-token CRUD (lookup by hash, revoke, rotate).
- **Auth/JWT**:
  - Access token: short-lived JWT used on API calls.
  - Refresh token: long-lived opaque secret, recommended via HttpOnly cookie, stored hashed in DB.
- **API**:
  - Added `POST /api/auth/refresh` and `POST /api/auth/logout` to spec.
  - Updated register/login responses to include refresh-token delivery (cookie or response field; cookie recommended).
- **Dev container**: No devcontainer changes yet (docs only).
